            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>In Kashmir, access to groceries isn't always easy. Shops are scattered, deliveries are inconsistent, and many stores aren't digitally connected at all. Customers often wait long hours or even days for basic household needs. Shopkeepers, too, lose customers due to lack of digital presence.</p>

        <section class="about glass-card">
            <h2>About the Developer</h2>
            <p>I'm an 18-year-old developer from Kashmir, working to make local shopping easier and smarter through technology.</p>
            <p>Growing up in Srinagar, I saw how disconnected our local businesses were from the digital revolution happening elsewhere. That's why I started Grozily — to bridge this gap and create something that truly works for our community.</p>
            <p>With no external funding or large team, I'm building this platform step by step — coding late nights, meeting with shopkeepers personally, and solving problems as they come.</p>
            <p>This is just the beginning, and I'm learning and building as I go — hoping to make a small difference in Kashmir's digital landscape, one store at a time.</p>

        <!-- Comparison Section -->
        <section class="comparison glass-card">
            <h2>Why Grozily is Different — and Has No Real Competition</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">Big delivery apps are broken by design...</p>
            
            <p>The current food delivery marketplace is dominated by large platforms that prioritize their own profits over the needs of local communities. These platforms charge vendors excessive fees (up to 30-35% per order), create complicated onboarding processes, and often limit service availability to "premium zones" only.</p>
            
            <h3>Grozily takes a fundamentally different approach:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Focus on local stores rather than chains, giving visibility to small businesses that are typically overlooked</li>
                <li>Minimal fees for vendors to ensure fair compensation and sustainability, with no complicated onboarding procedures</li>
                <li>Direct access for customers to products they need, with transparent pricing and no hidden fees</li>
                <li>Optimized delivery focusing on clusters rather than "premium zones," serving communities that larger platforms ignore</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>With Grozily, you'll never see:</h3>
            <ul class="never-list">
                <li><i class="fas fa-times"></i> Overpriced aggregators</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-times"></i> Complicated vendor setup</li>
                <li><i class="fas fa-times"></i> "Premium-only" zones</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Grozily is designed from the ground up to be a fair platform that prioritizes community needs over corporate profits, making it a truly unique solution in the delivery space.</p>
